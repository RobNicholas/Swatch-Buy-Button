# Swatch-Buy-Button
In the Product-detail.liquid they made a button and select. These call out to the eventsApp.js file. In there they use ajax to create a new product clone. 

The page.List-Collection is the code I used to make the nested collections. I created a new page and added the page.List-Collection template to the page. Along with this I created a navigation menu to link to the page. Under the nagvigation menu object I added the collections.
